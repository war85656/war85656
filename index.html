		<p style="color:orange;" "font-family:courier;">I have an awesome dog named <strong>Bennett</strong>. He is a bluetick coonhound, which are typically hunting dogs. I don't teach him to hunt, but he still loves to destroy things. <br> I adopted <strong>Bennett</strong> from a Humane Society in July 2017 after he was hit by a car. He was still a puppy but I didnt know that until his drugs wore off. He loves to eat things, such as: 
			<ol style="color:orange;">
  				<li>shoes</li>
  				<li>pillows</li>
  				<li>his bed</li>
			</ol>
		<p style="color:orange;"> Some of his other favorite things to play with are:	
			<ul style="color:orange;">
  				<li>tennis balls</li>
  				<li>sticks</li>
  				<li>dead squirrels</li>
			</ul>
		<p style="color:orange;" align="center"><img src="bennett.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt= "photo"></p>
		<p style="color:orange;">Right now he is staying with my parents because he has separation anxiety and would <small>destroy</small> my apartment if he was alone during the day. He loves to howl so he would also annoy my neighbors.</p>

		<p style="color:orange;">At home <strong>Bennett</strong> can play with my family's dog- <font size="18">Dorrie</font size>. Dorrie hates <strong>Bennett</strong> because <strong>Bennett</strong> is dumb and loud and annoying. I love sleeping with <strong>Bennett</strong> but he also wakes up way too early. <br> <strong>Bennett</strong> is great but also very expensive due to his destructive habits.
